        	<h4><u>Terms & Conditions</u></h4>
        	
        	<h4><u>Terms and conditions during beta testing</u></h4>
        	<h5>Valid from November 2017.</h5>
        	<p>
        	Lot Easy smartphone app and web application (referred to as "Lot Easy") is used for ordering food/beverages by an end customer (referred to as "you") using the Lot Easy app on his/her smartphone. As soon as the order is placed by you, it goes to a web application accessed by the staff at the cafe, restaurant, take-away place, food market, hotel, food truck (referred to as "eatery"). When the ordered items are ready, the Lot Easy order status is updated by the eatery staff and at the same time, the order status gets updated in your Lot Easy app. You can now either pick up the ordered items at the eatery counter or expect to be served by the eatery staff.
        	</p>
        	<br>
        	<p>Lot Easy is currently being tested in Denmark. The purpose of the test is to analyze how Lot Easy suits the Danish market: owners, staff, and guests at eateries. 
        	</p>
        	<br>
        	<p>
After the testing period, Lot Easy will be upgraded to incorporate the lessons learned. Lot Easy will be released in a new version in Denmark on a Danish server. A new set of terms and conditions will be released alongside.
   </p>
        	
<br>
<h4><u>Way of working</u></h4>
<p>
When you first download and install Lot Easy on your smartphone, you are requested to enter your name and phone number. Lot Easy sends a 6-digit code as an SMS and you must enter that code in Lot Easy in order to be registered as a user.
</p>

<p>
Lot Easy pays the fee of the SMS. It works only in Denmark using a Danish phone number.
</p>

<p>
When you have entered the code, you are now a registered user of Lot Easy and will not in future  uses of Lot Easy on the same phone and same phone number be requested to fill in the SMS code again.
</p>
<h5>Lot Easy is used the following way:</h5>
<ul>
<li style="font-size:14px;">  1.	Select "I am at Restaurant/Hotel/Resort
</li>
<li style="font-size:14px;">  2.	Browse the menu and add items to your order
</li>
<li style="font-size:14px;">  3.	View and edit your order
</li>
<li style="font-size:14px;">  4.	Confirm order
</li>
<li style="font-size:14px;">  5.	View status of your order
</li>
<li style="font-size:14px;">  6.	View order history
</li>
<li style="font-size:14px;">  
7.	Depending on the eatery, you either get served or pick up your food
</li>
<li style="font-size:14px;">  

8.	You pay directly to the eatery. Lot Easy has no payment option
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
The purpose of Lot Easy is to convey a service between you and the eatery. The eatery alone, and not Lot Easy company, is responsible for the service, the quality, and the price of your ordered items. If your order is underway for longer time than you expected or if you have other problems with your ordered items, you must contact the eatery staff. Lot Easy company is not able to take part in any disputes between you and the eatery. 
</p>

<h4>In order to use Lot Easy, you need:
</h4>
<ul>
<li style="font-size:14px;"> A mobile device (smartphone or tablet) to download Lot Easy from Play Store (Android) or App Store (IOS)
</li>
<li style="font-size:14px;"> A Danish phone number</li>
<li style="font-size:14px;"> Internet  connection (wifi or SIM)
</li>
</ul>
<h4><u>Drawbacks During Beta Testing</u></h4>
<p>Because Lot Easy is residing on a server in India, and the app is built for the Indian market, you may experience several drawbacks, which will be fixed after the testing period:
</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-size:14px;"> Lot Easy may have a long response time which can cause irritation and impatience on the eatery guest and staff
</li>
<li style="font-size:14px;">Lot Easy is not fully adapted to Denmark: for example, the decimal separator is a "point", not a "comma" (e.g. a price is given as 25.50 kr; not 25,50 kr.)</li>
<li style="font-size:14px;"> Certain functions and displays are not applicable in Denmark-however, they are visible in the app. This may cause confusion and bad user experience (e.g. the front screen in the phone app shows an option for delivery-this is not applicable)
</li>
<li style="font-size:14px;">There is no in-app payment. You have the full responsibility to pay your food at the counter of the eatery or when you are presented the bill
</li>

<li  style="font-size:14px;">
Status notifications are not are not pushed to you through the app (sound, flag on the app icon, banner,...). Instead, you need to open and close the order summary and look for the status (New, Accepted, Ready)
</li>
</ul>
